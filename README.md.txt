# Plane Wars
## This is the version download from a Chinese website called CSDN, wrote by somebody else.

I am Gary, a high school student from BDFZ, Beijing ,China.
There was such a game in WeChat, but itâ€™s removed for unknown reason. I like that game so I would like to recreate it and save it in my computer or share with you guys.
Maybe add some my own elements in.

What function does this code have originally:
A plane that can move with your mouse, and shoot unstoppably, never die even if you collide with others.

Some energies that move with random initial speed and random X-coordinate.

If the bullet collide with enemies, they disappear together.
